EBRAINS is a digital research infrastructure, created by the EU-funded Human
Brain Project, that gathers an extensive range of data and tools for brain
related research. EBRAINS capitalizes on the work performed by the Human
Brain Project teams in digital neuroscience, brain medicine and brain-inspired
technology.

The goal for this extension is to provide the necessary software adaptors to
inject and extract data and metadata in and out of the EBRAINS services and
infrastructure.

Command(s) provided by this extension

- `ebrains-kg2ds` -- Export a dataset in the [EBRAINS knowledge
  graph](https://kg.ebrains.eu) into a DataLad dataset
