EBRAINS is a digital research infrastructure, created by the EU-funded Human
Brain Project, that gathers an extensive range of data and tools for brain
related research. EBRAINS capitalizes on the work performed by the Human
Brain Project teams in digital neuroscience, brain medicine and brain-inspired
technology.

The purpose of this DataLad extension package is to represent and retrieve
EBRAINS datasets as DataLad datasets (without requiring downloading or
duplication of datasets hosted on EBRAINS) to make them compatible with
the wider DataLad ecosystem.

Commands provided by this extension

- `ebrains-authenticate` -- Obtain an EBRAINS authentication token
- `ebrains-clone` -- Export a dataset from the [EBRAINS Knowledge
  Graph](https://kg.ebrains.eu) as a DataLad dataset

See the documentation for details:
